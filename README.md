# Porn Is Dangerous

But you know that already; that's why you're here. This guidance is designed for the non tech savvy of you who want to employ some technical tips to protect yourself from the devastating impact of porn.

## Barriers are part of Best Practice

Self control is hard, so to improve your odds, we introduce barriers. Barriers:
* Are technical roadblocks or obstacles which are designed to force you to check yourself
* Are *not "silver bullets"*: they can be circumvented. Self control is still required.
* Give you the opportunity to exit from your thinking pattern so you can go an do something else, call a friend or spend time with your wife/partner and avoid porn.

# Content Filtering / Parental Controls can help

One of the easiest things you can do is to impose on yourself content filtering by using commonly available parental control services. The trick is to add this barrier to all devices you might access the internet from. When surfing the web on a device from home, one usually uses one of two means to access the internet: the home wifi/internet connection, or the devices' built in 3/4G/cellular/mobile data. If you're serious about adding a barrier using content filtering you'll try to filter *both* sources of internet access. Here are some ways you can filter your internet connections.

## Your home internet connection

[OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com) provide a free parental filtering service called *FamilyShield* which includes the filtering of porn. The filter works because you set it up on your home modem/router. The assumption is that all of your home devices access the internet via the modem/router so it's a reliable single gateway for filtering content. 

The other great thing OpenDNS do is take you step-by-step configuring your router. They have instructions for nearly every model so you really don't have an excuse not to try and get this set up. Head on over to https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/?url=familyshield and follow the instructions. 

Remember, in the instructions they will ask you to add the *IP addresses* for the DNS servers. You should enter the FamilyShield DNS servers which are [on the page above](https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/?url=familyshield), but repeated here too for convenience:

208.67.222.123  
208.67.220.123

The final step to making this barrier effective is preventing yourself from easily working around it. Here is the part where you need a friend or spouse: ask your friend/spouse or someone you trust to reset the master password on your home modem/router. This way only they have the power to disable the filter and the barrier is useful. If you don't know how to change this setting, feel free to ask a tech-savvy friend or relative for help. *This step is critical!* If you can undo the barrier easily then there is no point to it.

## Your mobile phone internet connection

The easiest way to circumvent a porn filter on your home router is to turn off your phone's wifi. Then you will use your mobile data from your phone provider. There are various ways to add barriers to your mobile devices. Choose one that works for you:

* **For Telstra customers, you can turn on a parental filter** much like the OpenDNS option above. This is probably the most reliable option. Make sure you ask your friend/spouse or someone you trust to reset the account password so you can't easily turn this filter off.
* **Use the built-in content filtering on your phone.** In iOS for Apple devices, there is a *Restrictions* feature (under *Settings* > *General* > *Restrictions*) which will allow the filtering of adult content (see the section *Allowed Content*). To enable Restrictions, a passcode is required: make sure you ask your friend/spouse or someone you trust to set this passcode so the barrier is useful.
* Android devices generally have more options and are harder to "lock down". It can be done and you may also be able to use the OpenDNS settings mentioned above to apply the same porn filtering on your Android device if you are willing to [do some reading and learn how it works](http://www.howtogeek.com/223530/how-to-lock-down-your-android-tablet-or-smartphone-for-kids/). Remember: *get someone else to set the password* once you know what is required to enable the filtering.
